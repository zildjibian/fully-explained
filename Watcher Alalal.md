The hint isn't really useful for this one so we'll have to search.<br>
If you enter "The other Alalalpartment" in City, youll find a Receiver tool.<br>
<br>
You can click while holding the tool and it'll change the channel.<br>
Now just search the main areas and find cameras, which are located in:<br>
- Ancient: The big tree in the middle
- Beach: Near Spongebob's house
- Cat House: 2nd floor
- City: Alalalstore
- Space: Near Ralalal (which is on the tall stone structure)
- Mountains: Near the statue
<br>
Now just go to Mountains then find a door at the back side of a mountain.<br>
Enter your User ID in the computer.<br>

### Step 2
Those colors give "132546" somehow,<br>
and looking at the back of the board shows "______alalal".<br>
