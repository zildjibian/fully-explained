Hint: Start in 2008<br>
Means that we have to start in 2008 Alalal<br>
<br>
Go grab this key then head into the locked apartment.<br>

<br>
<br>
Then go to 2008 Alalal and you'll see that these tiles appears in a pattern and are clickable.<br>

<br>
<br>
If you head on top of the same apartment and enter the broken glass, you'll see this grid.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73f62e41-cca8-4807-a0aa-f2aecfe96337)<br>
Applying this to those clickable tiles gives: "16 13 5 2 8"<br>
Remove spaces and you'll get "1613528", use that in the code input.<br>
Return to the broken glass and you'll get teleported to a brand new area.<br>
<br>

# Room 1

# Room 2
This room is splitted into 2 parts.

## Part 1: The Floor
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b30c822-1921-4577-b689-2dfa06211f16)<br>
Just a Hexahue cipher -> "TURKEY SANDWICH"<br>

## Part 2
```
PCKD KJLWSR
2 = 1 4 3
Read the hint. Break it up into four. 
```
TUR KEY SAND WICH<br>
2 = 1 4 3<br>
KEY = TUR WICH SAND (vigenere)<br>
Decode that -> "WITH CHEESE"<br>
<br>
Combine part 1 with part 2, add spaces, capitalize everything.<br>
**/e TURKEY SANDWICH WITH CHEESE**

# Room 2
We got 3 parts now.

## Part 1
```
1559520000
unicorn(no corn) + x -> unix
MDY (format)
User ID
```
Converting that to a Unix timestamp gives "Monday, June 3, 2019 12:00:00 AM" -> 632019<br>
User ID -> https://www.roblox.com/users/632019/profile <br>
His name is "**canned**"

## Part 2
That is the Merchant Flag of the Kingdom of Sardinia<br>
Sardinia -> **Sardine**

## Part 3
Liquid food -> **soup**<br>
<br>
<br>
Using the same rule as the previous room gives "**/e CANNED SARDINE SOUP**"<br>
