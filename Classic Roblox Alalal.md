Hint: Start in 2008<br>
Means that we have to start in 2008 Alalal<br>
<br>
Go grab this key then head into the locked apartment.<br>

<br>
<br>
Then go to 2008 Alalal and you'll see that these tiles appears in a pattern and are clickable.<br>

<br>
If you head on top of the same apartment and enter the broken glass, you'll see this grid.<br>

Applying this to those clickable tiles gives: "16 13 5 2 8"<br>
Remove spaces and you'll get "1613528", use that in the code input.<br>
Return to the broken glass and you'll get teleported to a brand new area.<br>
