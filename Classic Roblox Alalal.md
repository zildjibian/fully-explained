"**Hint: Start in 2008...**"<br>
Means that we have to start in 2008 Alalal<br>
<br>
Go grab this key then head into the locked apartment.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e807e5b-c16a-4f21-bb66-33bb8489ddf0)<br>
<br>
<br>
Then go to 2008 Alalal and you'll see that these tiles appears in a pattern and are clickable.<br>

<br>
<br>
If you head on top of the same apartment and enter the broken glass, you'll see this grid.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73f62e41-cca8-4807-a0aa-f2aecfe96337)<br>
Applying this to those clickable tiles gives: "16 13 5 2 8"<br>
Remove spaces and you'll get "1613528", use that in the code input.<br>
Return to the broken glass and you'll get teleported to a brand new area.<br>

# Room 1
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a46f3fca-76f2-40a5-85e1-f4675cf48e9c)<br>
This is just a normal keypad.<br>
Start at white => 7043760029 -> https://www.roblox.com/users/7043760029/profile<br>

# Room 2
This room is splitted into 2 parts.

## Part 1: The Floor
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b30c822-1921-4577-b689-2dfa06211f16)<br>
Just a Hexahue cipher => "**TURKEY SANDWICH**"<br>

## Part 2
```
PCKD KJLWSR
2 = 1 4 3
Read the hint. Break it up into four. 
```
Break it up => TUR KEY SAND WICH<br>
2 = 1 4 3<br>
KEY = TUR WICH SAND (vigenere)<br>
Decode "PCKD KJLWSR" => "**WITH CHEESE**"<br>
<br>
Combine part 1 with part 2, add spaces, capitalize everything.<br>
**/e TURKEY SANDWICH WITH CHEESE**

# Room 3
We got 3 parts now.

## Part 1
```
1559520000
unicorn(no corn) + x -> unix
MDY (format)
User ID
```
Converting that to a Unix timestamp gives "Monday, June 3, 2019 12:00:00 AM" -> 632019<br>
User ID -> https://www.roblox.com/users/632019/profile <br>
His name is "**canned**"

## Part 2
That is the Merchant Flag of the Kingdom of Sardinia<br>
Sardinia -> **Sardine**

## Part 3
Liquid food -> **soup**<br>
<br>
<br>
Using the same rule as the previous room gives "**/e CANNED SARDINE SOUP**"<br>

# Room 4
Room 4, 4 parts.
## Part 1
Common greeting; opposite of low.<br>
high -> **hi**

## Part 2
"hi" in binary is **0110100001101001**

## Part 3
Count the 1's and 0's.<br>
0110100001101001 => **1211421121**

## Part 4
https://www.roblox.com/users/1211421121/profile -> @raymond94512<br>
<br>
**/e raymond94512**

# Room 5
Not sure how many parts this room has...

## Right Side
If you look in the crossroads tower, you can see "3p03tfx; /a/".<br>
It's an Imgur link: https://imgur.com/a/3p03tfx <br><br>

Align the red line together.<br>

Overlay.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f260f2a-22cd-4620-a609-d21de70c0aa0)<br>
"**smorgasbord**"

## Left Side
Look on the billboard, 9i1UiiSJ. <br>
It's a Pastebin link: https://pastebin.com/9i1UiiSJ <br>
Unlock it with the word you got from Right Side.<br><br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39162844-c930-4a4b-a210-4ec48c160f3e)<br>
Jalalal!<br><br>
Once you got the code, say it in [RED ORANGE ORANGE TEAL]. <br>
If you remember the keypad from room 1, each one of them is assigned to color.<br>
[RED ORANGE ORANGE TEAL] => 1337<br>
Jalalal in 1337 is "**J414141**"<br>

## Room 5.1
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b1cd589-e746-4639-aaf6-46faa5fff347)<br>
This refers to "Invisible Egg of **Shadow**"

# Room 6
Each picture in the room has a text hidden on the picture itself.<br>

## Step 1
"Top of a doorframe."<br>
It's the doorframe connecting Room 4 to Room 5.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0407e72-82b1-440f-8009-d91c55c7782c)<br><br>
There are 3 hats inside Room 6, which are: Screw, Cheese Hat, Coif of Glory.<br>
This is referring to The Void Star Gift Box.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e34d84f-e7e0-4fe9-ba81-6df71c3c33b9)<br>
The secret password is "**ALGERNON**"

## Step 2
"On a rock in the basement."<br>
This refers to Room 5.1.<br>
"Eyes are key."<br><br>

If you look at the eyes of the figures in Room 6, they're either closed, open, or patched.<br>
Using the arrow order and lines as seperator;<br>
you'll get: "... .- .-.. .- -..", this is clearly morse which decodes to "**SALAD**"

## Step 3
"Vigenere encrypt."<br>
Self-explanatory.<br><br>
